I am an Associate Researcher at the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. I obtained my PhD from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), China. I received the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) 2023 Grand Finals Winners, 1st Place, Graduate Category, in 2023. (The first doctoral student in Chinese Mainland to win the honor.) My research focuses on Software Engineering, Mobile Testing, Deep Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. Specifically, I apply AI and light-weight program analysis technology in the following directions:

AI(LLM)-assisted automated mobile app development including requirement elicitation app GUI testing [ICSE'23a, ICSE'23b, ICSE'24a, ICSE'24b, FSE'25], usability [ASE'20, FSE'21, TSE'22, ASE'22], and bug replay [ICSE'23, ICSE'24].

Human machine collaborative testing including testing guide for testers [CHI'24, CHI'22, ICSE'22].

AI-empowered mining software repository including issue report mining [ESEM'20, ESEM'21].


My research interest includes Software Engineering and Human Machine Interaction. I have published 22 papers at the top international Software Engineering and Human Machine Interaction conferences/journal (CCF-A) with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D27QoFMAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>1509</span></strong></a>.

- Mobile applications have become a ubiquitous part of our daily life, providing users with access to various services and utilities. Text input, as an important interaction channel between users and applications, plays an important role in core functionality such as search queries, authentication, messaging, etc. However, certain special text (e.g., -18 for Font Size) can cause the app to crash, and generating diversified unusual inputs for fully testing the app is highly demanded. Nevertheless, this is also challenging due to the combination of explosion dilemma, high context sensitivity, and complex constraint relations. This paper proposes InputBlaster which leverages the LLM to automatically generate unusual text inputs for mobile app crash detection. It formulates the unusual inputs generation problem as a task of producing a set of test generators, each of which can yield a batch of unusual text inputs under the same mutation rule.

- Automated Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing plays a crucial role in ensuring app quality, especially as mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives. Despite the growing popularity of learning-based techniques in automated GUI testing due to their ability to generate human-like interactions, they still suffer from several limitations, such as low testing coverage, inadequate generalization capabilities, and heavy reliance on training data. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in natural language understanding and question answering, we formulate the mobile GUI testing problem as a Q&A task. We propose GPTDroid, asking LLM to chat with the mobile apps by passing the GUI page information to LLM to elicit testing scripts, and executing them to keep passing the app feedback to LLM, iterating the whole process.
